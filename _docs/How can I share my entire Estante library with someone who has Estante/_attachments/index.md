</video>

## Instructions
### On Both devices:
  1.  On your device, go to settings and look for Wi-Fi Direct.
  2.  Turn on Wi-Fi Direct. Note the name of the device.

### On your device:
  3.  Select your friend's device under Available Devices.
  4.  Tap to connect.

### On your friend's device:
  5.  Your friend should get a notice "Invitation to connect."

  7.  Open the Estante app and tap on the settings icon (three small squares on top of one another), above the gear icon.
  8.  Tap on "Send Library"
