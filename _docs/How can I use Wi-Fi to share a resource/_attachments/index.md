# How can I use Wi-Fi to share a resource?
You can easily share a resource with someone who also has Estante through your device's Wi-Fi Direct or via Wi-Fi.  Wi-Fi Direct is the recommended method as it is a more secure connection than standard Wi-Fi.

## A.  Connect to your friend's device using Wi-Fi Direct (preferred method)
First you need to connect to your friend's device through Wi-Fi Direct. To do this you and your friend need to turn on Wi-Fi Direct:

### On both devices:
  1.  Go to the Android Settings and look for Wi-Fi Direct.
  2.  Turn on Wi-Fi Direct. Note the name of your device.

### On your device:
  3.  Select your friend's device under available devices.
  4.  Tap to connect.

### On your Friends device:
  5.  Your friend should get a notice "Invitation to connect."
  6.  Tap Accept.

You have now successfully connected your two devices. Go to the section called "Transfer a resource using the QR code" (below).

## B.  Connect to your friend's device using Wi-Fi (second method)
### On both devices:
  1.  Go to the Android Settings and look for Wi-Fi networks.
  2.  Connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network.

You are now ready to transfer the resource using the QR code.

## Transfer a resource using the QR Code
  1.  Open Estante on both devices.
  2.  Choose the resource you want to share with your friend by tapping on the gear icon next to it.
  3.  At the top of the screen, tap on the QR code (labeled "Send to Estante").
  4.  Your friend needs to open the Estante menu in the upper right corner of Estante (the 3 boxes on top of each other).
  5.  Select "Receive Resources."  This turns on the device's rear-facing camera.
  6.  Then have your friend point the camera at your screen, your device will automatically capture the QR code.
  7.  Once the QR code is captured, the device brings up the "Sync" page.  Tap "Get" to receive the resource.  The document will be put into the same category it was in on your friends Estante Library.
